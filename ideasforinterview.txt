Reasons of why would be useful for me to go to the US

-Cultural comprehension: I enjoy getting to know new people. I keep in touch with a lot of people
who live abroad. Some of them I have met in person, in educational events like "Modelo de Naciones
Unidas", United Nations Model, some of them organized by OAJNU. Others, are people who share certain
interests with me, usually languages. I consider them very good friends and, in fact, many of
them have been constants in my life for years. Going to the US would allow me to know a lot of 
people who have very different lifestyles and culture than me, and that would enrich my way of 
seeing the world and understanding other people.

-In a more academic point of view, I have always been interested in english as a way of communicating
in my personal life, I use english as much as possible. In my notes at university, the books that 
I read, the movies and series that I watch, my social networks, they are all in english. Going to
the US would improve my english a lot.

I have always tried to change things in every institution I've been into, at least in some small
way, for the better. In my university, I've realized we lack an space to practise programming 
languages, and, alongside a few partners, we created a six month course of programming for our
freshmen, where they could learn with us, as equals. That broke a lot of barriers for them to learn
, being that sometimes, students are afraid of asking stuff to their teachers. I had already work
as an teacher's assistant in an english academy, so the course was my second teaching experience.

And I enjoyed it a lot. I've discovered that I love teaching. It is a hugely rewarding experience. 
I've heard that many people of hispanoparlant countries who go to the US are allowed to help in 
spanish courses. That would be an amazing experience, one that I may not ever have the chance to 
experience without a scholarship like Fullbright
